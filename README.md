**Database**: `retailsales_db`

This project demonstrates core SQL skills commonly used by data analysts, including database design, data insertion, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and business-driven analysis. Using a simulated online retail dataset, the project answers key business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.


## Objectives
**1. Design and create a normalized retail sales database.**
**2. Populate tables with realistic sample data.**
**3. Perform SQL queries using joins, aggregations, and subqueries.**
**4. Analyze sales performance, customer spending, and product trends.**
**5. Answer real-world business questions using SQL.**

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
  This project uses a realtional database named retail_sales_db to store and analyze retail sales data..

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE DATABASE RETAILSALES_DB

USE RETAILSALES_DB
```

### 2. Table Creation :-
 CUSTOMERS TABLE-
 Stores customer-realted information.
  ```sql
       CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    signup_date DATE
);
```
PRODUCTS TABLE :-
 Stores products-realted information.
 ```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```
ORDERS TABLE :-
Stores transaction detail and connects customers with products.
```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
```
###2.Inserted data :-
 Inserted data into customers.
```sql

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
(1,'Amit','Delhi','2023-01-10'),
(2,'Sneha','Mumbai','2023-02-12'),

```
Inserted data into products.
```sql
INSERT INTO Products VALUES
(101,'Laptop','Electronics',60000),
(102,'Mobile','Electronics',30000),
(103,'Headphones','Accessories',2000),
(104,'Keyboard','Accessories',1500),

(106,'Desk','Furniture',12000);
```
inserted data into orders.
```sql

INSERT INTO Orders VALUES
(1001,1,101,1,'2023-08-01'),

(1010,2,105,2,'2023-08-28'),
(1011,3,101,1,'2023-08-29'),
(1012,4,103,4,'2023-08-30');
```
####verifying data
```sq
SELECT *FROM Customers
SELECT *FROM Products
SELECT *FROM Orders
```
###3. Data Analysis & Findings
The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:


1.**Finding total number of customers per city**:
```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY city;
```

2. **Find total revenue generated by each product**.
```sql
SELECT p.product_name,
       SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

```

3. **Find top 3 best-selling products by revenue**:
```sql
SELECT  TOP 3 p.product_name,
       SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
```

4. **Find customers who spent more than ₹50,000.**:
```sql

SELECT c.customer_name,
       SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS total_spent
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING SUM(o.quantity * p.price) > 50000;
```

5. **Find monthly total sales.**:
```sql
SELECT MONTH(order_date) AS month,
       SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS monthly_sales
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date);
```

6. **Find customers who never placed an order.**:
```sql

SELECT C.customer_name
FROM Customers C
LEFT JOIN ORDERS O
ON C.customer_id=O.customer_id
WHERE O.customer_id IS NULL;
```

7. **Categorize customers based on spending**:
```sql

SELECT c.customer_name,
       SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS total_spent,
       CASE
           WHEN SUM(o.quantity * p.price) > 80000 THEN 'Premium'
           WHEN SUM(o.quantity * p.price) BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000 THEN 'Gold'
           ELSE 'Regular'
       END AS customer_category
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name;

```

8. **.Find the most popular product category**:
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 p.category,
       SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC

```

9. **Find average order value?.**:
```sql

SELECT AVG(order_total) AS avg_order_value
FROM (
    SELECT order_id,
           SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS order_total
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY order_id
) t;
```

10. **Find repeat customers (more than 1 order)**:
```sql
SELECT c.customer_name,
       COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 1;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Distribution:** Customers are spread across multiple cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, indicating a geographically diverse user base.
- **Revenue Contribution:** Electronics products (Laptop and Mobile) contribute the highest share of total revenue.
- **Top Customers:** A small number of customers account for a significant portion of total sales, highlighting high-value customers.
- **Product Performance:** Accessories such as Headphones and Keyboard show higher order frequency but lower revenue compared to Electronics.
- **Sales Trend:** Orders are consistently distributed across the month, with peak sales observed during mid to late August.
